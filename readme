# Open Source License Detector

This is a simple web-based tool that detects the license type of open-source projects from uploaded text files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, or `.LICENSE` files). The detector looks for common open-source license keywords within the file and returns the corresponding license name.

## Features
- Upload a file containing license information (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`, `README.md`).
- Detects popular open-source licenses including:
  - MIT License
  - GPL License
  - Apache License
  - BSD License
  - Creative Commons License
  - Mozilla Public License (MPL)
  - LGPL (Lesser GPL)
  - European Union Public License (EUPL)
- Displays the detected license along with a link to its official documentation.
- User-friendly and responsive interface.

## How It Works
1. Upload a `.txt`, `.md`, or `.LICENSE` file containing license information.
2. The detector scans the content for known keywords (e.g., "MIT", "GPL", "Apache License").
3. The tool identifies the license type and displays it along with a link to the official page for more information.
